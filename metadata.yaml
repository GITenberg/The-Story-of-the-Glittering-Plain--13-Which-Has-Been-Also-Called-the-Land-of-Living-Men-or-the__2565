description: "The Story of the Glittering Plain (full title: The Story of the Glittering\
  \ Plain which has been also called the Land of Living Men or the Acre of the Undying)\
  \ is an 1891 fantasy novel by William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer\
  \ to unite an imaginary world with the element of the supernatural, and thus the\
  \ precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. It is also important for\
  \ its exploration of the socialist themes that interested Morris.\nHis earlier fantasies\
  \ The House of the Wolfings and The Roots of the Mountains were to some degree historical\
  \ novels. Like these The Story of the Glittering Plain is set in a world similar\
  \ to the distant past of northern Europe. Morris would go on to develop the new\
  \ genre established in this work in such later fantasies as Child Christopher and\
  \ Goldilind the Fair, The Wood Beyond the World, The Well at the World's End, and\
  \ The Water of the Wondrous Isles.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
